					<h3>Tadika Ceria Gembira</h3>
					<p><b>TADIKA CERIA GEMBIRA</b> is a preschool educational institution for children. It was established in the year 2003. We teach social experience for children for their transition from home to school. Playing, activities, experience, and social interaction are accepted as essential aspects of developing skills and knowledge. We value play as an opportunity for learning as a child discovers how to communicate and interact with others whilst learning new skills and developing creativity and imagination. We acknowledge each child's efforts towards autonomy believing their confidence, self-esteem and consideration of others develop more positively when they feel they have some control in their world.</p>
